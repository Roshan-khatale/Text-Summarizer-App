AI in Healthcare,"Artificial Intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry. From patient monitoring to robotic surgery, AI is providing tools to improve diagnosis accuracy and speed. It is also making healthcare more accessible and affordable in remote areas. Moreover, AI is aiding drug discovery by identifying molecular combinations faster than traditional methods. However, ethical concerns, data privacy, and bias remain significant challenges that need to be addressed."
